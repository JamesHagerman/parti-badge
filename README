# #PartiBadge

The #PartiBadge is a Wi-Fi connected, full-featured, Particle Photon powered conference badge. Because who want to wear a piece of plastic around their neck when they can wear a PCB?

The #PartiBadge was designed by the Particle team and is currently used as an interactive learning platform for conferences and other developer events.
